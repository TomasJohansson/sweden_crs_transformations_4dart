A library for Dart developers.

Created from templates made available by Stagehand under a BSD-style
[license](https://github.com/dart-lang/stagehand/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:sweden_crs_transformations_4dart/sweden_crs_transformations_4dart.dart';

main() {
  var awesome = new Awesome();
}
```

# SwedenCrsTransformations
'SwedenCrsTransformations' is a C#.NET library for transforming geographic coordinates between the following three kind of CRS (Coordinate Reference Systems): WGS84, SWEREF99 and RT90.
(13 versions of SWEREF99, and 6 versions of RT90)

The library is based on [MightyLittleGeodesy](https://github.com/bjornsallarp/MightyLittleGeodesy/) which in turn is based on a [javascript library by Arnold Andreasson](http://latlong.mellifica.se/).

The main part of 'MightyLittleGeodesy' which has been kept is the mathematical calculations in the class 'GaussKreuger.cs'.
(although some modifications have been done in the class [GaussKreuger](https://github.com/TomasJohansson/sweden_crs_transformations/blob/csharpe_SwedenCrsTransformations/SwedenCrsTransformations/MightyLittleGeodesy/Classes/GaussKreuger.cs))

# NuGet release

No.  
I have currently not released it anywhere except from here at this github repository, and currently I have no plans of releasing it at NuGet neither.  

# Code example
Please note that the API is very different from the originally forked library.  
(the only significant part that remains from the forked library is the *internal implementation* using the GaussKreuger class)
```C#
using SwedenCrsTransformations;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

...

const double stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_latitude = 59.330231; // https://kartor.eniro.se/m/XRCfh
const double stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_longitude = 18.059196;

CrsCoordinate stockholmWGS84 = CrsCoordinate.CreateCoordinate(
    CrsProjection.wgs84,
    stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_longitude,
    stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_latitude
);

CrsCoordinate stockholmSweref99tm = stockholmWGS84.Transform(CrsProjection.sweref_99_tm);
Console.WriteLine("stockholmSweref99tm X: " + stockholmSweref99tm.LongitudeX);
Console.WriteLine("stockholmSweref99tm Y: " + stockholmSweref99tm.LatitudeY);
Console.WriteLine("stockholmSweref99tm 'ToString': " + stockholmSweref99tm.ToString());
// Output from the above:
//stockholmSweref99tm X: 674032.357
//stockholmSweref99tm Y: 6580821.991
//stockholmSweref99tm 'ToString': CrsCoordinate [ X: 674032.357 , Y: 6580821.991 , CRS: SWEREF_99_TM ]

IList<CrsProjection> allProjections = CrsProjectionFactory.GetAllCrsProjections();
foreach(var crsProjection in allProjections) {
    Console.WriteLine(stockholmWGS84.Transform(crsProjection));
}
